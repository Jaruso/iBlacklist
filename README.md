# uBlacklist
Blocks specific sites from appearing in Google and Duck Duck Go search results

## Description
This Chrome extension prevents blacklisted sites from appearing in Google and Duck Duck Go search results.

The same functionality is allegedly provided by [Personal Blocklist (by Google)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/personal-blocklist-by-goo/nolijncfnkgaikbjbdaogikpmpbdcdef). However, sites blocked by Personal Blocklist are only blocked in the news section, not the general search feature.

You can add rules on search result pages, or on sites to be blocked by clicking the toolbar icon. Rules can be specified either by [match patterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns) (e.g. `*://*.example.com/*`) or by [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) (e.g. `/example\.(net|org)/`).
